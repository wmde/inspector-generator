# Next steps for MVC

- [ ] Expand README
   - When to use
   - Generating classes
   - Using generated classes in tests (with possible inheritance to add
	   interfaces, traits, etc)
    - Workflow when generating (bootstrap vs standalone script, checking
		them in or not)
	- Inheritance behavior
	- Accessor bypass
- Throw in some static properties, see what happens

# Beyond MVC
- Add CI with GitHub Actions
- Allow partial spies (only specify needed properties)
- Add configurable code comments to file header
- Allow custom printers
- Configure with YAML
- Create PHAR executable release
- Use phive instead of composer
